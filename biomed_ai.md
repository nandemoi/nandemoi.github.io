# AI in Medical Research Interview

## Background

* EE/CE/IC Design Industry
* arranged intro and exercises in ML for roughly 6 weeks of 科技應用 last semester in 建中
* Why Biomedical?  
  1. Tried to self-study neural science → molecular biology
  2. in the semester a class oriented for medical pursuit, if again

## AI (ML) triumphs in taking Big Data to achieve  

### Successes in 

* Game Play / Competitions (AlphaGo)  
* Search Engine / Information Servers  
* Autonomous Vehicles  

## Common Characteristics in Applications

* image
* temporal related information

## Neural Network Models

* CNN
* RNN

## Medical Applications

* MRI readings  
* Pharmacology / Protein Folding (Structural Bioinformatics)

nodules/vocal cord disorders/These are lesions that develop in the larynx, often because of patterns of voice misuse such as belting out songs or yelling.  
monitor patients’ biometrics over long periods  
100 subjects, each with about a week’s worth of voice-monitoring data and several billion samples.  
The dataset contain signals captured from a little accelerometer sensor mounted on subjects’ necks.
