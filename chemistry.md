## Chap 1: Foundations

### 1.1 Overview

* matter consists of individual atoms
* macroscopic/microscopic worlds
  
### 1.2 Scientific Methods

1. making observations: qualitative/quantitative (measurement)
2. formulating hypotheses: a *possible* explanation for an observation
3. Performing experiments: test a hypothesis

* A theory (model): a set of tested hypotheses that gives an overall explanation of some natural phenomenon

1. observations
    * witnessed
    * can be recorded
2. theories (models)
    * an interpretation,
a *possible* explanation of *why* nature behaves in a particular way
    * inevitably change as more information becomes available
    * human inventions,
    attempts to explain observed natural behavior in terms of human experiences
    * educated guesses; 
    continue to experiment/refine → consistent with new knowledge → approach a more nearly complete understanding of nature
3. natural law
    * a summary of observed (measurable) behavior

| a law                   | a theory (model)                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| summarizes what happens | attempts to explain why it happens |

* Focus/Diversity dilemma
    * hypotheses are couched in the language of the theory
    * may limit our ability to see other possible explanations
* Scientists are human
    * prejudices
    * misinterpre data
    * emotionally attached to their theories and thus lose objectivity
    * play politics

### 1.3 Units of Measurement

* SI system (le Systeme International)

### 1.9 Classification of Matter (p.26)

* Matter: occupying space, having mass
* Matter exists in 3 States: 
  * solid: rigid, fixed volume and shape
  * liquid, gas
